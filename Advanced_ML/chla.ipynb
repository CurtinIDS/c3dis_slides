    "Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain a wealth of patient medical information that can: save valuable time when an emergency arises; eliminate unnecesary treatment and tests; prevent potentially life-threatening mistakes; and, can improve the overall quality of care a patient receives when seeking medical assistance.  Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) wanted to know if the records could be mined to yield early warning signs of patients that may require extra care or an indication of the severity of a patient's illness.  In this lab we have access to the work and results of CHLA's applied use of deep neural networks on EHRs belonging to roughly 5,000 pediatric ICU patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use deep learning techniques to provide medical professionals an analytic framework to predict patient mortality at any time of interest. Such a solution provides essential feedback to clinicians when trying to assess the impact of treatment decisions or raise early warning signs to flag at risk patients in a busy hospital care setting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will use the python library [```pandas```](http://pandas.pydata.org) to manage the dataset provided in [HDF5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format) format and deep learning library [```Keras```](https://keras.io) to build recurrent neural networks ([RNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network)).  In particular, this lab will construct a special kind of deep recurrent neural network that is called a long-short term memory network ([LSTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory)). Finally, we will compare the performance of this LSTM approach to standard mortality indices such as PIM2 and PRISM3 as well as contrast alternative solutions using more traditional machine learning methods like logistic regression."

    "Next we define a folder which contains both training and testing datasets stored in HDF5 format. Using this folder we define file paths inputs (X) and their associated labels (y).  [HDF5](http://www.hdfgroup.org/) stands for hierarchical data format version number 5.  The HDF format is designed specifically to store and organize large amounts of scientific data and was originally designed by [National Center for Supercomputing Applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Supercomputing_Applications).  Common file extensions include ```.hdf```, ```.hdf5```, or simply ```.h5```.  The HDF format has become very popular and is well maintained.  As a result, HDF5 is a flexible and robust format having API support in most languages and library compatibilty with Windows, OS X and Linux. It is important to note that HDF is a binary format and hence lacks the human readable transparency of text based CSV files.  However, HDF file format is much faster in performance, efficient in storage size, and scales well from small proof of concept ideas to [very large operational projects](https://www.hdfgroup.org/eos_vignette/)."

    "## Recurrent Neural Network Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The recurrent neural network ([RNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network)) is effectively a traditional feed-forward network with feedback.  In a traditional feed-forward network all inputs are considered independent.  However, the input to an RNNs also includes the previous output state.  This allows RNNs to model very complex sequences of input and it can be shown that RNNs are, in fact, [Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) (see [here](http://binds.cs.umass.edu/papers/1995_Siegelmann_Science.pdf)).\n",
    "<img src=\"images/rnn.jpg\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*image credit: wildml.com*</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory RNNs can make use of information in arbitrarily long sequences, but in practice they are limited to looking back only a few steps due to what is called the [*vanishing gradient*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_gradient_problem) problem.  In essence, during the traning process, as errors are backpropagated through time, inputs from previous time steps get exponentially down weighted and are eventually driven to zero (i.e. vanish).  \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a variant of the RNN called the [Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) network published by [Hochreiter & Schmidhuber](http://www.bioinf.jku.at/publications/older/2604.pdf) in 1997. LSTMs do not have vanishing gradient problems.  LSTM is normally augmented by recurrent gates called [forget gates](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/gers02a/gers02a.pdf). As mentioned, a defining feature of the LSTM is that it prevents backpropagated errors from vanishing (or exploding) and instead allow errors to flow backwards through unlimited numbers of \"virtual layers\" unfolded in time. That is, the LSTM can learn \"[very deep](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7828)\" tasks that require memories of events that happened thousands or even millions of discrete time steps ago. Problem-specific LSTM-like topologies can be [evolved](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-04277-5_76) and can work even when signals contain long delays or have a mix of low and high frequency components.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now construct a RNN in order to ingest the data and make a prediction at each timestep of the patient's probability of survival. The image below shows an abstract representation of the model to be constructed using ```Keras```.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/drted_rnn.svg\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "At each time step the measurements recorded will be used as input and a probability of survival prediction will be generated. It is important to note that this enables a real time monitor of the patient's probability of survival and insight into the patient's trajectory."

    "### Constructing LSTM Network with Keras\n",
    "[Keras](https://keras.io) is a minimalist but modular neural networks library written in Python.   ```Keras``` is capable of running on top of either the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) or [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) frameworks.  Here we are interested in using Theano as it excels at RNNs in general and LSTM in particular.  Note that some frameworks such as [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org) do not support RNNs.  Keras was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.  The ```Keras``` library allows for easy and fast prototyping of solutions and supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.  Furthermore, ```Keras``` supports arbitrary connectivity schemes (including multi-input and multi-output training).\n",
    "Finally, ```Keras``` runs on either CPU or GPU and is compatible with Python 2.7-3.5."

    "We created a single LSTM.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Binary cross entropy loss function* is used because it is the theoretically optimal cost function for a binary classification problem (in this case, mortality). However, occasionally the Mean Squared Error (MSE) cost function is used since it tends to be a bit more stable numerically.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Dropout W* is used because it randomly drops elements of the input vector (It drops the same elements of the vector for every time step of the sequence). This forces the network to leverage information contained in potentially covariate variables (for instance – for a particular sample Heart Rate may be ‘dropped’, but a combination of systolic/diastolic blood pressure and breathing rate may provide a reasonable proxy).\n",
    " \n",
    "*Dropout U* is used for similar reasons to traditional dropout in CNNs. It forces the network to utilize all of the hidden nodes such that too much information is not contained in a single hidden unit. In practice this tends to lead to more stable networks.\n",
    " \n",
    "*RMSprop* optimizer is selected because it is a good general optimizer for LSTMs.  See [here](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) for more details.  \n",
    " \n",
    "*LR=0.005* is selected in order to find a reasonable local minimum within a small number of epochs for time consideration.  Typically one would likely use an even smaller LR and allow the network to take smaller ‘learning steps’ but that choice requires more training rounds to converge (i.e. slower training).\n",
    " \n",
    "As always with neural networks, there was some amount of hyper-parameter tuning.  It is important to keep in mind that this network has not been optimally tuned.  A handful of reasonable default values were chosen to create a state-of-the-art mortality predictor in the least amount of GPU cycles possible (for tutorial purposes).\n",

    "## Comparison against baselines: PRISM3 and PIM2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both PIM2 and PRISM3 are scoring systems for ICU and surgical patients.  Models that predict the risk of death of groups of patients admitted to intensive care are available for adult, pediatric and neonatal intensive care. By adjusting for differences in severity of illness and diagnosis, these models can be used to compare the standard of care between units and within units over time. They can also be used to compare different methods of organising intensive care. Estimating mortality risk is also an important component of comparing groups of patients in research trials.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Pediatric Index of Mortality (PIM) was originally developed as a simple model that requires variables collected at the time of admission to intensive care. The original PIM was developed predominantly in Australian units; in the first report only one of the eight units was actually available in the United Kingdom. The PIM2 is a revised mortality index using a more recent data set from 14 intensive care units, eight in Australia, four in the UK, and two in New Zealand. In the analysis for PIM2, 20,787 patient admissions of children less than 16 years of age were included. Since PIM2 estimates mortality risk from data readily available at the time of ICU admission it is therefore suitable for continuous monitoring of the quality of paediatric intensive care. PIM2 uses the first value of each variable measured within the period from the time of first contact to one hour after arrival in the ICU.  If information is missing (e.g. Base Excess is not measured) PIM2 records zero, except for systolic blood pressure, which should be recorded as 120. All consecutive admissions are included.  See [Slater et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12541154) for full details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the Pediatric Risk of Mortality ([PRISM](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3048900)) score was originally developed around 1988 from the Physiologic Stability Index ([PSI](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6728571)) to reduce the number of variables required for pediatric ICU mortality risk assessment, from 34 (in the PSI) to 14 and to obtain an objective weighting of the remaining variables.  Here <a href=\"http://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(97)70065-9/abstract\">PRISM3</a> is an updated version of the scoring system published in 1996 which has several improvements over the original model. However, it is only available under licence and is not widely used outside of the United States.  The PRISM3 score has 17 physiologic variables subdivided into 26 ranges. The variables determined most predictive of mortality were minimum systolic blood pressure, abnormal pupillary reflexes, and stupor/coma."
